# < Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Marisa />

An Italian former Architect who recently decided to switch careers and become a Full Stack Web Developer. 
To help me with my transition, I decided to attend Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp in Madrid where I graduated as a Full-Stack MERN developer.

I like to take project from the conceptual stage of visual mock-ups and carry it through development all by myself. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React Redux, Hooks 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Open Source project 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Code, Design, Travels, Italy   

I'm always looking to grow my personal and professional skills, so don't hesitate to contact me or to give me suggestions and advices.
